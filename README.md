## Running Locally

To get the WorkOutWF client running successfully in development, you'll also need to have the WorkOutWF api running locally (links above).  

Please follow the API README on how to get the server up and running.

Then:

1) Start the api server with `npm run dev`
2) Clone this repo
3) Run `npm install`
4) Run `npm start`
